/**
 * Hash table based implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface.  This
 * implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * <tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  (The <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class is roughly equivalent to <tt>Hashtable</tt>, except that it is
 * unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
 * the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order
 * will remain constant over time.
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic
 * operations (<tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>), assuming the hash function
 * disperses the elements properly among the buckets.  Iteration over
 * collection views requires time proportional to the "capacity" of the
 * <tt>HashMap</tt> instance (the number of buckets) plus its size (the number
 * of key-value mappings).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial
 * capacity too high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is
 * important.
 *
 * <p>An instance of <tt>HashMap</tt> has two parameters that affect its
 * performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 * <i>capacity</i> is the number of buckets in the hash table, and the initial
 * capacity is simply the capacity at the time the hash table is created.  The
 * <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to
 * get before its capacity is automatically increased.  When the number of
 * entries in the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the
 * current capacity, the hash table is <i>rehashed</i> (that is, internal data
 * structures are rebuilt) so that the hash table has approximately twice the
 * number of buckets.
 *
 * <p>As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good
 * tradeoff between time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the
 * space overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of
 * the operations of the <tt>HashMap</tt> class, including
 * <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).  The expected number of entries in
 * the map and its load factor should be taken into account when
 * setting its initial capacity, so as to minimize the number of
 * rehash operations.  If the initial capacity is greater than the
 * maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash
 * operations will ever occur.
 *
 * <p>If many mappings are to be stored in a <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * instance, creating it with a sufficiently large capacity will allow
 * the mappings to be stored more efficiently than letting it perform
 * automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table.  Note that using
 * many keys with the same {@code hashCode()} is a sure way to slow
 * down performance of any hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys
 * are {@link Comparable}, this class may use comparison order among
 * keys to help break ties.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of
 * the threads modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i> be
 * synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 * that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
 * associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
 * structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
 *   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by all of this class's "collection view methods"
 * are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
 * the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>

    /*
     * Implementation notes.
     *
     * This map usually acts as a binned (bucketed) hash table, but
     * when bins get too large, they are transformed into bins of
     * TreeNodes, each structured similarly to those in
     * java.util.TreeMap. Most methods try to use normal bins, but
     * relay to TreeNode methods when applicable (simply by checking
     * instanceof a node).  Bins of TreeNodes may be traversed and
     * used like any others, but additionally support faster lookup
     * when overpopulated. However, since the vast majority of bins in
     * normal use are not overpopulated, checking for existence of
     * tree bins may be delayed in the course of table methods.
     *
     * Tree bins (i.e., bins whose elements are all TreeNodes) are
     * ordered primarily by hashCode, but in the case of ties, if two
     * elements are of the same "class C implements Comparable<C>",
     * type then their compareTo method is used for ordering. (We
     * conservatively check generic types via reflection to validate
     * this -- see method comparableClassFor).  The added complexity
     * of tree bins is worthwhile in providing worst-case O(log n)
     * operations when keys either have distinct hashes or are
     * orderable, Thus, performance degrades gracefully under
     * accidental or malicious usages in which hashCode() methods
     * return values that are poorly distributed, as well as those in
     * which many keys share a hashCode, so long as they are also
     * Comparable. (If neither of these apply, we may waste about a
     * factor of two in time and space compared to taking no
     * precautions. But the only known cases stem from poor user
     * programming practices that are already so slow that this makes
     * little difference.)
     *
     * Because TreeNodes are about twice the size of regular nodes, we
     * use them only when bins contain enough nodes to warrant use
     * (see TREEIFY_THRESHOLD). And when they become too small (due to
     * removal or resizing) they are converted back to plain bins.  In
     * usages with well-distributed user hashCodes, tree bins are
     * rarely used.  Ideally, under random hashCodes, the frequency of
     * nodes in bins follows a Poisson distribution
     * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) with a
     * parameter of about 0.5 on average for the default resizing
     * threshold of 0.75, although with a large variance because of
     * resizing granularity. Ignoring variance, the expected
     * occurrences of list size k are (exp(-0.5) * pow(0.5, k) /
     * factorial(k)). The first values are:
     *
     * 0:    0.60653066
     * 1:    0.30326533
     * 2:    0.07581633
     * 3:    0.01263606
     * 4:    0.00157952
     * 5:    0.00015795
     * 6:    0.00001316
     * 7:    0.00000094
     * 8:    0.00000006
     * more: less than 1 in ten million
     *
     * The root of a tree bin is normally its first node.  However,
     * sometimes (currently only upon Iterator.remove), the root might
     * be elsewhere, but can be recovered following parent links
     * (method TreeNode.root()).
     *
     * All applicable internal methods accept a hash code as an
     * argument (as normally supplied from a public method), allowing
     * them to call each other without recomputing user hashCodes.
     * Most internal methods also accept a "tab" argument, that is
     * normally the current table, but may be a new or old one when
     * resizing or converting.
     *
     * When bin lists are treeified, split, or untreeified, we keep
     * them in the same relative access/traversal order (i.e., field
     * Node.next) to better preserve locality, and to slightly
     * simplify handling of splits and traversals that invoke
     * iterator.remove. When using comparators on insertion, to keep a
     * total ordering (or as close as is required here) across
     * rebalancings, we compare classes and identityHashCodes as
     * tie-breakers.
     *
     * The use and transitions among plain vs tree modes is
     * complicated by the existence of subclass LinkedHashMap. See
     * below for hook methods defined to be invoked upon insertion,
     * removal and access that allow LinkedHashMap internals to
     * otherwise remain independent of these mechanics. (This also
     * requires that a map instance be passed to some utility methods
     * that may create new nodes.)
     *
     * The concurrent-programming-like SSA-based coding style helps
     * avoid aliasing errors amid all of the twisty pointer operations.

    //根据key取hash值的函数也要关注一下，它称之为“扰动函数”
    //key的hash值，并不仅仅只是key对象的hashCode()方法的返回值，还会经过扰动函数的扰动，以使hash值更加均衡。
    //因为hashCode()是int类型，取值范围是40多亿，只要哈希函数映射的比较均匀松散，碰撞几率是很小的。
    //但就算原本的hashCode()取得很好，每个key的hashCode()不同，但是由于HashMap的哈希桶的长度远比hash取值范围小，默认是16
    //所以当对hash值以桶的长度取余，以找到存放该key的桶的下标时，由于取余是通过与操作完成的，会忽略hash值的高位。
    //因此只有hashCode()的低位参加运算，发生不同的hash值，但是得到的index相同的情况的几率会大大增加，这种情况称之为hash碰撞。
    //即，碰撞率会增大。
    //扰动函数就是为了解决hash碰撞的。它会综合hash值高位和低位的特征，并存放在低位，因此在与运算时，相当于高低位一起参与了运算，以减少hash碰撞的概率。
//    1 对key的值首先进行hashCode()运算：通用方法，根据对象的内存地址，返回一个特定的哈希码
//    2 二次处理哈希码 ：进行无符号右移16位，求得键对应的真正的hash值
//    3 计算存储的数组的位置即hash值 ： 二次处理的哈希码和数组长度减一 进行异或运算
//    4 获取到hash值后再和桶的长度减一进行异或，获取下标index
    
//    进行上面操作的目的
//    提高 存储key-value的数组下标位置 的随机性 & 分布均匀性，尽量避免出现hash值冲突
//    首先经过hashCode（）处理的哈希码为什么不能直接当桶的下标
//    很简单，，，因为哈希码和数组的大小范围不匹配，就是直接计算出来的哈希码可能不在数组范围里面
//
//    为什么在计算数组下标前，需对哈希码进行二次处理：扰动处理？
//    加大哈希码低位的随机性，使得分布更均匀，从而提高对应数组存储下标位置的随机性 & 均匀性，最终减少Hash冲突
//
//    为什么采用 哈希码 与运算(&) （数组长度-1） 计算数组下标？
//    根据HashMap的容量大小（数组长度），按需取 哈希码一定数量的低位 作为存储的数组下标位置，从而 解决 “哈希码与数组大小范围不匹配” 的问题

//    为撒要和桶的长度减一异或呢？
//    由于哈希表的容量都是 2 的 N 次方，在当前，元素的 hashCode() 在很多时候下低位是相同的，这将导致冲突（碰撞）

//    如果还是产生了频繁的碰撞，会发生什么问题呢？
//    用树来处理频繁的碰撞。利用红黑树替换链表，这样复杂度就变成了O(1)+O(logn)了，这样在n很大的时候，能够比较理想的解决这个问题

                	threshold就是 (int)(initialCapacity*loadFactor)
            2、否则就按默认的算 initialCapacity = 16，threshold = 12（默认值以及加载因子的计算公式）
        如果已经有元素了：
        	那么直接扩容2倍，如果oldCap >= DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY了，那么threshold也扩大两倍

                            比如原来容量是16，那么就相当于e.hash & 0x1111 
                            （0x1111就是oldCap - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15），
                            现在容量扩大了一倍，就是32，那么rehash定位就等于e.hash & 0x11111 
                            （0x11111就是newCap - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31）
                            现在(e.hash & oldCap) == 0就表明了
           e.hash & 0x10000 == 0，这样的话，不就是
                            已知： e.hash &  0x1111 = hash定位值Value
                             并且  e.hash & 0x10000 = 0
                            那么   e.hash & 0x11111 不也就是
                            原来的hash定位值Value吗？

                            那么就只需要根据这一个二进制位就可以判断下次hash定位在
                            哪里了。将hash冲突的元素连在两条链表上放在相应的位置
                            不就行了嘛。

//问题总结：
//1什么时候会使用HashMap？他有什么特点？
//是基于Map接口的实现，存储键值对时，它可以接收null的键值，是非同步的，HashMap存储着Entry(hash, key, value, next)对象，把这个当作一个结点，进行存储。
//
//2HashMap线程安全吗？为什么？
//线程不安全，因为HashMap没有使用sychronized同步关键字，在添加数据put()时，无法做到线程同步，当多个线程在插入数据时，如果发生了哈希碰撞，可能会造成数据的丢失，然后在在扩容resize()时，也无法做到线程同步，当多个线程同时开启扩容，会各自生成新的数组进行拷贝扩容，最终结果只有一个新数组被赋值给table变量，其他的线程均会丢失。
//
//3如何保证HashMap线程安全
//Hashtable，ConcurrentHashMap，Synchronized Map
//
//4.HashMap的工作原理？
//通过hash的方法进行存储结构构建hash表，通过put和get存储和获取对象。存储对象时，我们将K/V传给put方法时，它调用hashCode计算hash从而得到bucket位置，进一步存储，HashMap会根据当前bucket的占用情况自动调整容量(超过Load Facotr则resize为原来的2倍)。获取对象时，我们将K传给get，它调用hashCode计算hash从而得到bucket位置，并进一步调用equals()方法确定键值对。如果发生碰撞的时候，Hashmap通过链表将产生碰撞冲突的元素组织起来，在Java 8中，如果一个bucket中碰撞冲突的元素超过某个限制(默认是8)，则使用红黑树来替换链表，从而提高速度。
//
//5.知道get和put的原理吗？equals()和hashCode()的都有什么作用？
//对结点的key进行hash运算操作，计算下标，也就是要放到那个桶里面，如果碰撞的话，就在这个桶的链表或者树里面进行查询结点。
//
//6.hash的实现方式
//在jdk1.8后，是通过hashCode()的高16位异或低16位实现的：(h = k.hashCode()) ^ (h >>> 16)，主要是从速度、功效、质量来考虑的，这么做可以在bucket的n比较小的时候，也能保证考虑到高低bit都参与到hash的计算中，同时不会有太大的开销
//
//7.扩容时候机制
//jkd1.8这块，当发现现在的桶的占有量已经超过了容量 * 负载因子时候，进行扩容，直接扩容桶的数量为之前的2倍，并且重新调用hash方法，重新计算下标，然后再把之前的结点放到数组里面。
